# bezier_easeinout
Simple framework to test out Bezier Ease-in, Ease-Out of Animated Frames
Starting point is a sequence of .png files that show an Animation (extracted from GIF).
Different hard-coded Ease-In, Ease-Out bezier shapes are offered.
The sequence of .png files is then to be shaped according to the Bezier shape - ie Ease-In and then Ease-out. Playing the Animation in real time will show the Ease-in, Ease-out motion 
see mainwindow.cpp for more detailed description.
Open invitation to model a better Ease-in Ease-out interpolation of Animated sequence of images. Current attempt is shown but it is not satisfactory
